# SolidFire

[![pnpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-pnpm-cc00ff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pnpm)](https://pnpm.io/)

A minimal, yet powerful library that puts realtime Firebase data into Solid signals.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently in Development üõ†Ô∏è
I got the idea from [SvelteFire](https://github.com/codediodeio/sveltefire) to make this lib for a few side projects but I've only implemented what I needed so far. Right now I'm in the process of copying this over from the version implemented in my apps.

## Quick start

Install it:

```bash
npm i solidfire
# or
yarn add solidfire
# or
pnpm add solidfire
```

Use it:

```tsx
import solidfire from 'solidfire'
```
